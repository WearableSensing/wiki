# LSL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The lab streaming layer (LSL) is a system for the unified collection of measurement time series in research experiments that handles both the networking, time-synchronization, near real-time access as well as optionally the centralized collection, viewing and disk recording of the data.

Let's go over how to use Wearable Sensing data within LSL. We'll be using a variety of tools to stream, record, and analyze your EEG data.

Please visit our github to download the latest [`dsi2lslGUI`](https://github.com/WearableSensing/LSL) release.

If you wish to build the `dsi2lslGUI` from source, you can find it at our [github](https://github.com/WearableSensing/App-WearableSensing).
