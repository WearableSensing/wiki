# What type of external triggers are supported?

The system accepts TTL-style pulse triggers, as well as parallel or serial outputs from your computer. The voltage output should be between 3 and 12 V. 

The DSI-24 supports 8-bit trigger inputs, and the DSI-7 and DSI-VR300 accept 4-bit trigger inputs. We offer a Trigger Hub with various accessories including: photodetector, audio detector, and push-button triggers. This can be accomplished in a wired and wireless manner.

In addition, we support software triggering via Lab Streaming Library (LSL).
