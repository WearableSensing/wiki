# Do the DSI devices work with popular Stimulus Presentation Software (Presentation, E-Prime, PsychoPy)?

Yes! The system accepts triggers that can be used to synchronize stimuli with recorded EEG data. Please see our {doc}`Integrations <../../../examples/index>` page for more information on currently supported software (PsychoPy, BCI2000, etc.) and reach out about your specific interfacing needs if not already covered.
