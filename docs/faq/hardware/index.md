## Are your dry electrodes active?

Yes. Our dry sensors are active: there are amplifiers right behind the electrode tips.

## How many times can the electrodes be used before they should be replaced?

Our electrodes tips are specified, designed and tested for >100 uses without signal degradation. We recommend monitoring the electrode performance and replacing them when you notice a decline in signal quality.

## What is the battery life of the devices?

The DSI-24 has two hot-swappable batteries, meaning that the headset will keep working without interruption if one battery is taken out and replaced. Each battery lasts approximately 8-12 hours on a single charge.

The DSI-7 has one battery that lasts over 12 hours in continuous use. 

The DSI-VR300 has a battery built into the headset that lasts 8-12 hours.

Excluding the DSI-VR300, which has its own charging method, all batteries can be removed and re-charged with the provided charger in a few hours.

## How do I clean the devices?

The systems are cleaned with their supplied brushes and 70% isopropanol alcohol. Cleaning takes on average less than 1 minute. Please refer to the device manual for detailed cleaning instructions.
