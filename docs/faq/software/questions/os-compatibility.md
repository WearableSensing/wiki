# What operating systems does DSI-Streamer work on?

We currently do not have plans to make our system compatible across different OS, but we are always looking to expand our capabilities, and are willing to work with customers or collaborators to customize hardware and software to meet their needs (usually we do so under funded collaborations).  Additionally, our software has the ability to stream data in real-time through a TCP/IP socket or LSL, so you could stream the data from the PC to a Mac if you wanted to process the data on Mac software.
