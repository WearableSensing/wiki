# Do these devices support real-time data streaming?

Yes, Wearable Sensing's devices support real-time data streaming. You can stream data directly to your computer or other devices for immediate analysis using TCP/IP, DSI API or Lab Streaming Library (LSL).

You can download the Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) from its [official repository](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-WearableSensing) and our real-time streaming software from our {doc}`Downloads <../../../help/downloads/index>` page.
