# Can data be imported into MATLAB?

Yes, both the .csv and .edf file formats can be imported into MATLAB (and other 3rd party software). Often when using MATLAB for EEG data processing, EEGLab is leveraged. We have a plugin available on our Downloads page to import data from our devices into EEGLab.

Real-time streaming can also be established with other software via the TCP/IP socket or via Lab Streaming Layer (LSL). Please see our {doc}`Integrations <../../../examples/index>` page for more information on currently supported software and reach out to us about your specific interfacing needs if not already covered.
