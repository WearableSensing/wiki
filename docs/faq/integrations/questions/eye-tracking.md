# Do the DSI devices work with Eye-Tracking or other hardware systems?

Yes! The system accepts triggers that can be used to synchronize data between different hardware systems. In addition, if using a system supported by Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) the data and triggers can be synchronized using that protocol.

Our system is robust to electronic interference and should not cause interference with other systems. Please ask us about our Wireless Trigger Hub and its functionality. It can support interfacing with other hardware.
